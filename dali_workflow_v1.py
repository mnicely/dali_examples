# Example 1
# Implement the default functionality of DALI's External Source
# in a single CPU process

# Command
# python3 dali_workflow_v1.py --imageFolder='./images/304A/' --num_read_processes=16 --batch_size=16

# To profile with Nsight Systems
# nsys profile -s none -t cuda,nvtx --stats=true python3 <script> <arguments>

# NOTE:
# This implementation doesn't account for duplicates
